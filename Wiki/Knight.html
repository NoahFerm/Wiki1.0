        <h3>Overview</h3>
		
		<h3>Knighthood</h3>
<li>Medic</li>
<li>Archer</li>
			<h4>Missions</h4>
The missions can vary from chores, to guard duty, to escorts, investigations, expeditions, explorations, hunting, spying to war 
missions and many others.
		<h3>High School</h3>
Students in the 7th grade to 9th grade are called Pages and in the 10th grade to 12th grade are Squires. Each of the Pages get a kind 
of mentorship from one of the Squires. The Squires are supposed to teach them and by doing so they learn themselves. They get a team 
from their class during the 10th grade and they are a part of this team even after graduation because they have teamwork and know each 
other well. The Squire teams also get mentorship from real knights, one knight per team, and get to come with them on missions, serve 
them and learn from them during the 3 years. There’s a few weeks during each year where the Squires are supposed to be with the Knight 
for all of their missions that entire time. At graduation the Squire is dubbed a Knight but sometimes continues the mentorship with 
the older knights.

			skills.
			<h4>Junior Tournaments</h4>

		<h3>Appearance</h3>
		Knights are mainly humans and in some cases human hybrids or beings whose appearance is close enough to be passable as humans 
		without anyone noticing they're not. The knights wear armor and are equipped with weapons of their choice.

        <h3>History</h3>
		At first, only noblemen could become knights, but one talented boy changed that, he wasn’t a nobleman but he was accepted as a 
		knight and after that, you didn’t have to be a nobleman to become one. He became one of the most famous knights in history for 
		his courage and skills. The old king knew he had to trust the knights with his life, and therefore only noblemen could serve 
		as knights. The boy was rejected, but he was very chivalrous and earned his place.
