</p>
</div>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
          
Zev is an Alpha Werewolf and Seer who mostly goes by his nickname Zev, also known as Aelyas. He is a <a href="Knight.html">knight</a> 
and the leader of a pack that includes many other creatures than just <a href="Werewolf.html">werewolves</a> who work hard to fight 
against the Cult, help and protect innocent lives and nature as a whole.
          
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
         <p> 
He grew up with his mother Emma Collins, father Alvaro Yáñez Collins and his best friend and brother in all but blood, 
<a href="Kaiden.html">Kaiden</a>. As a kid he was hyperactive but quiet and very smart but had zero ability to focus. He and Kaiden 
met in kindergarten and they were very mischievous kids who often got into trouble. He and Kaiden were practically inseperable and did 
everything together, like twins. <br><br>
Zev was always a very anxious kid, but his anxiety escalated after young Zev, at the age of 7 was alone at the hospital visiting his 
mom when he witnessed her death. He often suffered panic attacks.<br><br>
He got a support dog, a golden retriever named Comet at a really young age because of his anxiety and also due to his powers of 
visions of the future, past and present that often caused nightmares, seizures and hallucinations.
          </p>
        <h3>Throughout the Story</h3>
At the start of high school, Zev goes missing. He was discovered by the Cult to have powers and was hunted down and captured. While 
he was a captive, he was experimented on, tortured and trained to be a weapon. He was also bitten by one of the cultists and became a 
werewolf. For months he lived in a cell next to an older boy named Usamah, a werelion.
        <h3>Personality & Traits</h3>
        <h3>Physical Description / Appearance</h3>
Zev has a kind and gentle baby face. His hair is dark brown and messy, usually longer during winter and shorter during summer, much 
like summer and winter fur for animals. His eyes are brown. 
His eyelashes are long and dark and his lips are coral-pink and almost look like lipstick. His voice is light, a little hoarse 
sounding. It’s a soft voice that is comforting to listen to.
He has a slim and athletic body, not muscular. His length is medium, not short or tall. He was short until he was around 15-16, but 
then he grew quickly.<br>
<br>He wears simple and comfortable clothes that aren’t expensive or fancy. Usually slim fit clothes, not big or baggy. He often wears 
T-shirts, hoodies, mostly dark colored jeans or jeans-like pants or shorts, sweatpants when he’s doing something active. As for shoes, 
he wears light and soft boots that are easy to move with when on mission and sneakers when off duty.<br>
<br>Later he sometimes has a small ponytail on the back top of his hair and blonde front of his hair. He also has a leg brace on his 
right leg after his nerves in his knee were damaged when his knee was broken during torture. The leg healed but the nerves did not so 
he is paralyzed from the knee and down.
        <h3>Powers & Abilities</h3>
	<p>
	Zev often has visions that can be false and real memories including someone else's, dreams including nightmares and daydreams, 
	hallucinations, strong feelings, random knowledge, drawing or writing random things, talking nonsense, random motions, patterns. 
	Anything he does could be clues or warnings to something, even if he doesn't know it himself, he mostly do them subconsciously or 
	unconsciously. Random things can activate his visions such as sight, hearing or touch, but he can't activate them himself most of 
	the time and he can't stop them. His visions are often traumatic and cause him panic attacks. His visions sometimes cause seizures. 
	One thing he can almost always activate is through touch, such as touching an object or person and see, hear or feel significant 
	historical, futuristic or present events or information about them.<br><br>
        He also possesses the common powers of a werewolf. The powers of a werewolf are so strong that he has some problems getting 
		used to them and getting control of himself during full moons, urges he gets and controlling himself when he gets strong 
		emotions, such as anger, happiness, worry and also when he panics.<br>
		<li>Transformation - Zev can transform into a brown wolf with glowing amber eyes. His clothes do not transform with him, so 
		he usually takes them off before transforming. He can also transform into a demi-wolf. This makes his jaws get more hair, his 
		nose bridge gets wider, his eyebrows get hairies, his ears become slightly pointed, his eyes become glowing amber colored, his 
		teeth become fangs and his nails become claws. He also has the ability to partially shift, changing only his eyes, his fangs 
		and/or his claws. When he’s overwhelmed with negative emotions, which mostly happens before he learns how to fully control 
		himself, he loses control and automatically shifts. This mostly makes him shift into a demi-wolf or only his eyes, fangs and 
		claws. When this happens he might be a danger to others or destroy things around him. He repeats quotes Usamah taught him to 
		regain control.
		He learns to control his shifts, however this can change if something deeply affects him and he loses control and causes him 
		to shift and act uncontrollably. His werewolf urges are always there, but he blocks them out the best he can.</li>
		<li>Strength - Although he doesn’t show it, Zev’s physical strength exceeds human capacity due to lycanthropy.</li>
		<li>Speed - Due to being half wolf, he can move faster than ordinary humans.</li>
		<li>Stamina - He has the stamina of wolves. He can move for a longer time than ordinary humans without having to stop to catch 
		his breath.</li>
		<li>Agility - He can move, jump, climb and run faster than ordinary humans without difficulty or exhaustion.</li>
		<li>Durability - The werewolf body is physically tougher and more resistant to injuries, although he still feels pain, but 
		normal injuries mostly aren’t fatal to him, unless done by any silver material.</li>
		<li>Heightened senses - Zev has the senses of a wolf. Sight, smell and hearing.</li>
		<li>Animal instincts - He has the instincts of an animal, he can feel when something is wrong and if there is someone they 
		can’t trust. He can feel danger approaching and bad weather like storms.</li>
		<li>Claws and fangs - He has extremely sharp claws and fangs when he transforms or partly transforms.</li>
		<li>Lie Detection - Due to the enhanced hearing, he can detect a lie by listening to the heartbeat and breathing of another 
		person, unless the person is a really good liar.</li>
		<li>Empathy - The werewolf senses are so strong that he can feel the emotions of other beings through touch or scent.</li>
		<li>Intelligence - Zev is very intelligent with a high IQ. He’s really good at noticing patterns, even if he doesn’t always 
		know what the things means. He’s good at figuring out what stuff mean from patterns.</li>
		<li>Healing - His body is able to heal and regenerate damaged parts of the body at a faster rate than ordinary humans, though 
		it still takes some time, leaving only a scar or nothing depending on the severity. Sometimes however, if he’s under deep 
		emotional trauma, like guilt, his body might not heal like it’s supposed to. He also learns to share this with another being 
		when touching, absorbing their pain, but he feels it instead.</li>
        <li>Premonitory dreams - He often has dreams preceding a real event that seems to foretell its occurrence.</li>
        <li>Psychometry - He has the ability to discover facts about an event or person by touching inanimate objects associated with 
		them.</li>
        <li>Automatic writing - He can sometimes make predictions by subconsciously writing.</li>
        <li>Clairaudience - the power to hear sounds said to exist beyond the reach of ordinary experience or capacity. He can hear 
		sounds that are like visions, that can predict or give clues to something.</li>
        <li>Clairvoyance - The power to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through visions.</li>
        <li>Remote viewing - He can sense and gather information about a distant unseen target.</li>
	</p>
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
	<p>
	Zev has the typical weaknesses of a werewolf.
		<li>Overwhelming emotions - Intense negative emotions such as anger, stress or sadness might force him to lose control and 
		shift. If he doesn’t regain control, he might hurt someone or destroy things.</li>
		<li>Guilt - Extreme guilt may keep him from healing. If he doesn’t want to heal, even subconsciously, he might not.</li>
		<li>Offense - He doesn’t use offense in fights, which makes him rely on evasiveness and defense. His determination to not use 
		violence might have consequences.</li>
		<li>Other lives - His biggest weakness is not something about himself, but other lives. No one can get to him by threatening, 
		hurting or torturing him. But if it’s done to someone else, he might do anything to stop it, even sacrificing himself. If he 
		can save, help or protect someone by sacrificing or risking himself, he will.</li>
		<li>Trauma & anxiety - Zev sometimes gets panic attacks, nightmares, hallucinations.</li>
		<li>Sleep - Due to trauma and anxiety, he often has trouble with insomnia. He might also get a lot of nightmares, sleep 
		paralysis and somnambulism; sleep walking.</li>
		<li>Silver - Wounds caused by silver doesn’t heal automatically and the material itself burns against his skin.</li>
		<li>Mercury - Same as Silver.</li>
		<li>Aconite - Wolfsbane is highly toxic to werewolves. Wolfsbane may affect his behaviour and if it somehow gets inside of 
		him it may cause severe illness and spread inside his body and kill him.</li>
		<li>Belladonna - Nightshade plant poisonous to werewolves.</li>
		<li>Mistletoe - Poisonous to humans and werewolves, leads to death if untreated.</li>
		<li>Electricity - Keeps werewolves weak and in human form.</li>
		<li>Pain - Intense pain keeps werewolves weak and in human form.</li>
		<li>Mortality - Any injuries that are cause instant death, for example to the heart or brain. He can die from blood loss if 
		he is prevented from healing.</li>
		<li>Dying - If he is dead, he can’t save anyone and he knows it. But he would still risk his life for other people. He would 
		first figure out another way, then sacrifice himself if it gives someone else a chance to live. By dying, people close to him 
		would be deeply affected, and he really doesn’t want to cause that. “Death doesn’t happen to you, it happens to everyone 
		around you.”</li>
		<li>Course of action - Struggle between doing what is right, doing what is kind, doing what is wise and doing what is 
		necessary. If it comes down to an impossible choice between someone’s life or something that saves or helps a lot people, a 
		person like Zev has an insanely hard time. Also when he has to choose between people in general.</li>
		<li>Paralyzed leg - His right leg is paralyzed from the knee and down due to torture. His knee was cracked and it healed, but 
		his nerves were damaged so he can’t move the bottom half of the leg. He wears a brace to support it so that he can walk.</li>
